## Course Topics |3 things I enjoyed learning about
 
1. How to use and navirgate Github (make repos, integrate with R studio, fork repos)! 
    + Github was totally unapproachable to me before the class and I never thought I would use it. Now, I'm excited to use it as a tool for my research.
2. Tips for reading in data and creating tidy data. I had no idea you could "scrape" data with a URL in your R code.
3. R markdown tools for publishing. 
    + I knew it was possible to write your thesis in RMarkdown but I thought it was clunky. I didn't realize all the formatting tools like font, citations, and formatting were available to make it easier. I plan to do this!
